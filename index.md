### CPSC 120

* [Lab 7](* [Lab 7](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-07-emmett-lim-arjun-dahiya/tree/main/part-2)

Lab 7, part 2 was one of my favorites because the concept of conditionals and lists was the same when I made a blackjack game in Java. However, in this game, it continued on using a main function that was called on after the game was completed in case the user wanted to play again. Another interesting part was the multi assignment of variables such as A where it could either be 1 or 11 depending on the situation. 

* [Lab 10](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-10-arjun-and-thomas)

Lab 10 part 2 was also an interesting lab due to the purpose of it taking the name of each county from a vector. It gives me a hint of how current search systems work, and how they are implemented into an index while creating new ones. The target, to crease a two dimensional data structure form std::vector to organize string and store all the names

* [Lab 8](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-08-emmett-and-arjun/tree/main/part-3)

Lab 8 part 3 was one of our first animation programs that we tackled in the course. What I found interesting was the use of ANSI & ASCII Animation with key commands such as get and threads. It was new knowledge on how input file stream worked and was interesting to learn.
